                <p>
                    Cookies are small data files. When you visit a website, the website sends the cookie to your
                    computer. Your computer stores it in a file located inside your web browser.
                    <br>
                    Cookies do not transfer viruses or malware to your computer. Because the data in a cookie does not
                    change when it travels back and forth, it has no way to affect how your computer runs, but they act
                    more like logs (i.e. they record user activity and remember stateful information) and they get
                    updated every time you visit a website.
                    <br>
                    We may obtain information about you by accessing cookies, sent by our website. Different types of
                    cookies keep track of different activities. For example, session cookies are used only when a person
                    is actively navigating a website. Once you leave the website, the session cookie disappears. For a
                    more detailed list of cookies we use, please read the relevant section below.
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-bolder text-lg pt-4 pb-2">Why are Cookies Useful?</p>
                <p>
                    We use functional cookies to analyse how visitors use our website, as well as track and improve our
                    websiteâ€™s performance and function. This allows us to provide a high-quality customer experience by
                    quickly identifying and fixing any issues that may arise. For example, we might use cookies to keep
                    track of which website pages are most popular and which method of linking between website pages is
                    most effective. The latter also helps us to track if you were referred to us by another website and
                    improve our future advertising campaigns.
                    <br>
                    Another use of cookies is to store your log in sessions, meaning that when you log in to the Members
                    Area to deposit funds, a "session cookie" is set so that the website remembers that you have already
                    logged in. If the website did not set this cookie, you will be asked for your login and password on
                    each new page as you progress through the funding process.
                    <br>
                    In addition, functional cookies, for example, are used to allow us to remember your preferences and
                    identify you as a user, ensure your information is secure and operate more reliably and efficiently.
                    For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access our
                    trading platform, and recall your preferences, such as which language you wish to see when you log
                    in.

                        The information provided by analytical cookies allows us to analyse patterns of visitor

                        website which may require maintenance. The information is anonymous (i.e. it cannot be used to
                        identify you and does not contain personal information such as your name and email address) and
                        it is only used for statistical purposes. Behavioral cookies are similar to analytical and
                        remember that you have visited a website and use that information to provide you with content
                        which is tailored to your interests.

                    choose to disable cookies from your web browser, but this would mean that our website and other

                    Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting
                    <br>
                    DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request
                    that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic
                    companies. This website does not currently respond to DNT requests.
