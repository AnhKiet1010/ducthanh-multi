                    <br>
                    VGF Global Limited is part of the VGF Group. Each entity of the VGF Group has its own
                    separate Privacy Policy. Such entities operate their own websites and as such, if you are interested
                    in learning about how such entities process your personal data, please refer to their corresponding
                    privacy statements which may be found on their specific websites.
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-bolder pb-20 pt-40">Safeguarding the confidentiality of your personal

                    The Company respects the privacy of any users who accesses its website(s), and it is therefore
                    committed to taking all reasonable steps to safeguard any existing or prospective clients,
                    applicants and website visitors.
                    <br>
                    The Company keeps any clients’/potential clients’ personal data in accordance with the applicable
                    data protection laws and regulations.
                    <br>
                    We have the necessary and appropriate technical and organisational measures and procedures in place
                    to ensure that your information remains secured at all times. We regularly train and raise awareness
                    to all of our employees on the importance of maintaining, safeguarding and respecting your personal
                    information and privacy. We regard breaches of individuals’ privacy very seriously and will impose
                    appropriate disciplinary measures, including dismissal where necessary. The personal information you
                    provide us with when registering yourself as a user of the Company’s site(s) and/or of its services
                    is classified as registered information, which is protected in several different ways. You can
                    access your registered information after logging in to the Members Area by entering a username and a
                    password that you select. It is your responsibility to make sure that your password is only known to
                    you and not disclosed to anyone else. Registered information is securely stored in a safe location
                    and only authorised personnel have access to it via a username and a password. All personal
                    information is transferred to the Company over a secure 128-bit SSL connection and thus all
                    necessary measures are taken to prevent unauthorised parties from viewing any such information.
                    Personal information provided to the Company that does not classify as registered information is
                    also kept in a safe place and accessible by authorised personnel only via a username and a password.
                    <br>
                    Transmission of information via the internet is not always completely secure but the Company
                    endeavors to protect your personal data by taking serious precautions. Once we have received your
                    information, we will apply procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

                        There are a number of legal obligations emanating from the relevant laws to which we are subject
                        as well as statutory requirements (e.g., anti-money laundering laws, financial services laws,
                        corporation laws, privacy laws and tax laws). There are also various supervisory authorities
                        whose laws and regulations we are subject to (e.g. the IFSC). Such obligations and requirements
                        impose on us necessary personal data processing activities for credit checks, identity
                        verification, payment processing, compliance with court orders, tax law or other reporting
                        obligations and anti-money laundering controls.

                    Generally, we require that organisations outside the VGF Group who handle or obtain personal

                    We may transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area to other VGF Group
                    companies as well as service providers (i.e. processors) who are engaged on our behalf. To the
                    extent we transfer your information outside the EEA, we will ensure that the transfer is lawful and
                    that processors in third countries are obligated to comply with the European data protection laws or
                    other countries’ laws which are comparable and to provide appropriate safeguards in relation to the
                    transfer of your data in accordance with GDPR Article 46. If we make transfers to processors in the
                    USA, we may in some cases rely on applicable standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules,
                    the EU-US Privacy Shield or any other equivalent applicable arrangements.
                    <br>
                    In view of the above, your personal information may be processed by staff in the VGF Group
                    operating outside the EEA who work for us, another VGF Group entity or for one of our service

                    accordance with the express written terms which govern our business relationship (which are

                <p>
                    Safeguarding the privacy of your information is of utmost importance to us, whether you interact
                    with us personally, by phone, by mail, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We will

                    access, modification or disclosure.
                    <br>
                    When we consider that personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was
                    collected, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the
                    records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. For example, we
                    are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain the following, for a

                    obligation to retain that data. Such request will be subject to any retention limits we are required

                    Your Personal Information and Retention Period'. If we have disclosed your personal information to

                    You can ask us to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances
                    such as if you contest the accuracy of that personal information or object to us processing it. It
                    will not stop us from storing your personal information. We will inform you before we decide not to
                    agree with any requested restriction. If we have disclosed your personal information to others, we
                    will inform about the restriction if possible. If you ask us, if possible and lawful to do so, we

                <b class="block">Automated decision-making and profiling</b>
                If we have made a decision about you based solely on an automated process (e.g. through automatic
                profiling) that affects your ability to use the services or has another significant effect on you, you
                can request not to be subject to such a decision unless we can demonstrate to you that such decision is
                necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us. Even where a decision
                is necessary for entering into or performing a contract, you may contest the decision and require human
                intervention. We may not be able to offer our services or products with you, if we agree to such request
                (i.e. end our relationship with you).

                    have no liability to you in this respect.

                    The Company may disclose your personally identifiable information as required by rules and
